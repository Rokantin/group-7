# 🔐 Group 7 – Crypto with Fun!

Welcome to our project!  
This page contains our 3 interactive exercises on Block Cipher.  
Each exercise is built with a different tool (Kahoot, Educaplay, ...).

## 📘 Topic: Block Cipher

### 🟢 Exercise 1 – Kahoot Quiz
- **Tool**: Kahoot  
- **Link**: [Play the quiz]()  
- **Description**: A 10-question quiz on modes of operation.
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  A mode of operation defines how block ciphers handle data larger than one block by chaining blocks together or generating keystreams.
  Different modes (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB) affect security by changing how each block depends or does not depend on the previous ones.

### 🔵 Exercise 2 – YES or NO
- **Tool**: Educaplay
- **Link**: [YES or NO](https://fr.educaplay.com/ressources-pedagogiques/26752026-block_cipher.html)  
- **Description**: YES or NO (True or False) challenge where players test their knowledge of block cipher fundamentals.
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  A block cipher is a symmetric encryption method that transforms fixed-size blocks of data (like 128 bits) using a secret key.

### 🟣 Exercise 3 – Other Tool (e.g., Quizizz, H5P, LearningApps)
- **Tool**: Quizizz  
- **Link**: [Try it here](https://quizizz.com/...)  
- **Description**: Multiple-choice puzzle with exponentiation mod n.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  Exponentiation in modular arithmetic is used in **Diffie–Hellman** key exchange and RSA.
